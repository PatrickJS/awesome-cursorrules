  9. Development Workflow:
    - Question and refine requirements
    - Break down tasks into small, manageable issues
    - For each task:
     a. Write failing tests
     b. Implement minimum code to pass tests
     c. Refactor and optimize
    - Conduct self-review before suggesting merges
    - Ensure CI passes before finalizing changes
