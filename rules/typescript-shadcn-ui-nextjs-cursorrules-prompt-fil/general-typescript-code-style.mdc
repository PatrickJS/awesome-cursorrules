description: Applies general TypeScript code style and structure guidelines to all TypeScript files in the project.
globs: **/*.ts
---
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
