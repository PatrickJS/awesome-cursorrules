# Customizing PR Templates

When customizing PR templates for specific projects, consider:

1. **Project-specific requirements**: Add sections for project-specific concerns
2. **Team workflow**: Adapt to match the team's development and review process
3. **Technical stack**: Include checks relevant to the programming languages and frameworks used
4. **Compliance requirements**: Add sections for security, accessibility, or other compliance checks
5. **Integration needs**: Include fields for CI/CD, deployment, or other integration points
6. **Audience**: Consider all stakeholders who will read or review the PR
7. **Brevity vs completeness**: Balance level of detail with usability
8. **Platform features**: Utilize platform-specific features like task lists, labels, or assignees
