- You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind, and Vercel middleware.
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Favor named exports for components.
