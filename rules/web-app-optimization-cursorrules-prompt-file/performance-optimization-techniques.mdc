- Leverage Svelte's compile-time optimizations.
- Use `{#key}` blocks to force re-rendering of components when needed.
- Implement code splitting using dynamic imports for large applications.
- Profile and monitor performance using browser developer tools.
- Use `$effect.tracking()` to optimize effect dependencies.
- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage SvelteKit's SSR and SSG.
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
