- Adhere to the following guidelines in your code:
  - Utilize early returns for code readability.
  - Use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements instead of CSS or <style> tags.
  - Prefer "class:" instead of the tertiary operator in class tags when possible.
  - Employ descriptive variable and function/const names, and prefix event functions with "handle," such as "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
  - Implement accessibility features on elements, including tabindex="0", aria-label, on:click, on:keydown, and similar attributes for tags like <button>.
  - Use consts instead of functions, and define a type if possible.
