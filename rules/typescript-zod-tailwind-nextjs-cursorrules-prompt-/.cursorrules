# Coding Style Guide

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

Naming Conventions:
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

TypeScript Usage:
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Use Zod for form validation

Syntax and Formatting:
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX

Error Handling and Validation:
- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Use Zod for form validation
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors

UI and Styling:
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a desktop-first approach

Performance Optimization:
- Minimize 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Remix Components (RSC)
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading

Key Conventions:
- Use proper URL search parameter state management
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Limit 'use client'

When React Server Components (RSC) are used:
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR
- Use only for Web API access in small components
- Avoid for data fetching or state management
