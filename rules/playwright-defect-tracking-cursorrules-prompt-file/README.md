# Playwright Defect Tracking Prompt

A specialized .cursorrules prompt for creating comprehensive defect reproduction and tracking tests using Playwright with TypeScript and case ID tagging.

## What You Can Build

- **Defect Reproduction Tests**: Precise test cases that reliably reproduce reported bugs
- **Regression Test Suites**: Tests that verify fixed defects stay fixed in future releases
- **Case ID Linked Tests**: Tests directly connected to manual test cases through ID tags
- **Categorized Test Suites**: Well-organized tests with proper category and team tagging
- **Evidence-Based Reports**: Test runs with built-in evidence collection and reporting
- **Structured Testing Hierarchies**: Logical organization of tests by feature and team

## Benefits

- **Manual-to-Automation Traceability**: Clear mapping between manual test cases and automated tests
- **Organized Test Structure**: Logical grouping of tests by feature and category
- **Complete TypeScript Support**: Full type safety for defect tracking test code
- **Streamlined Reporting**: Built-in support for generating detailed test reports
- **Team Ownership**: Clear indication of which team owns each test suite
- **Category-Based Execution**: Ability to run tests by category (smoke, regression, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Evidence**: Automated screenshots and logs for defect documentation

## Synopsis

This prompt helps QA teams create comprehensive defect tracking and reproduction tests using Playwright with case ID tagging. It focuses on organizing tests logically, maintaining traceability to manual test cases, and generating structured reports for defect tracking.

## Overview of .cursorrules Prompt

The .cursorrules prompt guides QA engineers in creating effective defect tracking tests using Playwright with these key elements:

- **TypeScript Detection**: Automatically detects and adapts to TypeScript usage in the project
- **Case ID Tagging**: Framework for including manual test case IDs in square brackets ([C1234])
- **Test Categories**: System for categorizing tests as [smoke], [regression], [defect], etc.
- **Team Ownership**: Method for indicating which team owns the test with team name tags
- **Configuration Example**: Sample config file for the QA shadow reporting system
- **Example Test Patterns**: Detailed examples of defect tracking tests with proper ID tagging
- **Structured Organization**: Guidelines for organizing tests in a logical hierarchy
- **Best Practices**: Eight essential practices for effective defect tracking and reporting
