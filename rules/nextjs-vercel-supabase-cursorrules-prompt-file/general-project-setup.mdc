- Use Next.js with the App Router (not Pages Router).
- Use Vercel AI for AI-related functionalities.
- Use Supabase for database and authentication, leveraging its type safety.
- Use Tanstack Query for data fetching and caching.
- Use Material UI for UI components.
- Potentially use Orval for API call typing, Tanstack Query integration, and mock service worker testing.
- When implementing something with Next.js, explain it as if I am new to Next.js and offer to explain more. Never create app/Creating app/ will break things
- If you feel I should replace elements of my stack above, always tell me.
- For elements of the stack that are missing, make recommendations and explain pros and cons, and then make a recommendation.
- My app folder is src/app
