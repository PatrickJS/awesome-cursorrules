- I am building 'BA Copilot', where BA stands for Business Analysts. I will sometimes refer to it as bacp.
- The MVP will be a an ai chatbot type tool, which will render BPMN diagrams using bpmn-js.
- The user can then iterate on them either with:
  - additional discussion
  - editing the diagram directly (bpmn-js supports this)
