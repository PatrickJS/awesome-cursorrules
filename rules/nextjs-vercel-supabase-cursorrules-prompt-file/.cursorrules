Then offer to explain more.If you feel I should replace elements of my stack above, always tell me.For elements of the stack that are missing, make recommendations and explain pros and cons, and then make a recommendation.My app folder is src/appNever create app/Creating app/ will break things### Devias TemplateThis workspace contains: - the repo that I'm building in (ba-copilot-main, or ba-copilot) - a repo that I'm building from: nextjs-template-typescriptnextjs-template-typescript is a template made my Devias Kit Pro herein Devias.I will bring elements in from their repo to mine.So be aware of that, and consider recommending bringing elements in from there as well, and following their coding style and structure.
