Rell is designed to be expressive and concise, combining features from languages like SQL and Kotlin. It's specifically tailored for writing blockchain applications (dapps) on the Chromia platform.

Key features:
- Statically-typed
- Blockchain-oriented
- Built-in database operations
- Modular design

# Core Concepts

## Modules

Rell code is organized into modules. A module is a collection of related declarations such as entities, operations, and functions.

Example of a simple module:
