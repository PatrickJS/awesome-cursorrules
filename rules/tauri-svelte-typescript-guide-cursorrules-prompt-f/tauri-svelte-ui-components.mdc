- Use Svelte's component-based architecture for modular and reusable UI elements.
- Leverage TypeScript for strong typing and improved code quality.
- Follow Svelte's naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables and functions).
- Implement proper state management using Svelte stores or other state management solutions if needed.
- Use Svelte's built-in reactivity for efficient UI updates.
