description: Rules to define development process.
globs: **/*
---
- Conduct thorough code reviews via Pull Requests
- Include clear PR descriptions with context and screenshots
- Implement comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Prioritize meaningful tests over high coverage numbers
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)
- Make small, incremental commits for easier review and debugging
