globs: **/*.ts
---
- Enable all strict mode options in tsconfig.json
- Explicitly type all variables, parameters, and return values
- Use utility types, mapped types, and conditional types
- Prefer 'interface' for extendable object shapes
- Use 'type' for unions, intersections, and primitive compositions
- Document complex types with JSDoc
- Avoid ambiguous union types, use discriminated unions when necessary
