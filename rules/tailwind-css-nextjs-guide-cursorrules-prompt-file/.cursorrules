Prompt Generation Rules:

- Analyze the component requirements thoroughly
- Include specific DaisyUI component suggestions
- Specify desired Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Mention any required TypeScript types or interfaces
- Include instructions for responsive design
- Suggest appropriate Next.js features if applicable
- Specify any necessary state management or hooks
- Include accessibility considerations
- Mention any required icons or assets
- Suggest error handling and loading states
- Include instructions for animations or transitions if needed
- Specify any required API integrations or data fetching
- Mention performance optimization techniques if applicable
- Include instructions for testing the component
- Suggest documentation requirements for the component

General Component Creation Guidelines:

- Prioritize reusability and modularity
- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Follow React best practices and patterns
- Implement proper prop validation
- Consider internationalization requirements
- Optimize for SEO when applicable
- Ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices

General Rules:

- Enable strict TypeScript (strict: true in tsconfig.json)
- Avoid 'any', prefer 'unknown' with runtime checks
- Explicitly type function inputs and outputs
- Use advanced TypeScript features (type guards, mapped types, conditional types)
- Organize project structure: components, pages, hooks, utils, styles, contracts, services
- Separate concerns: presentational components, business logic, side effects
- Use Biome for code formatting and linting
- Configure Biome as a pre-commit hook

Next.js Rules:

- Use dynamic routes with bracket notation ([id].tsx)
- Validate and sanitize route parameters
- Prefer flat, descriptive routes
- Use getServerSideProps for dynamic data, getStaticProps/getStaticPaths for static
- Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) where appropriate
- Use next/image for optimized images
- Configure image layout, priority, sizes, and srcSet attributes

TypeScript Rules:

- Enable all strict mode options in tsconfig.json
- Explicitly type all variables, parameters, and return values
- Use utility types, mapped types, and conditional types
- Prefer 'interface' for extendable object shapes
- Use 'type' for unions, intersections, and primitive compositions
- Document complex types with JSDoc
- Avoid ambiguous union types, use discriminated unions when necessary

TailwindCSS and DaisyUI Rules:

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes for styling
- Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain consistent order of utility classes
- Use Tailwind's responsive variants for adaptive designs
- Leverage DaisyUI components for rapid development
- Customize DaisyUI components only when necessary
- Define and use design tokens in tailwind.config.js

Starknet React Rules:

- Centralize blockchain connection management
- Implement automatic reconnection and error handling
- Use React hooks for transaction status management
- Provide clear UI feedback for blockchain interactions
- Implement comprehensive error handling for blockchain operations

Cairo Rules:

- Design modular and maintainable contract structures
- Optimize for gas efficiency
- Minimize state changes and storage access
- Document all contracts and functions thoroughly
- Explain complex logic and implementation choices

Development Process:

- Conduct thorough code reviews via Pull Requests
- Include clear PR descriptions with context and screenshots
- Implement comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Prioritize meaningful tests over high coverage numbers
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)
- Make small, incremental commits for easier review and debugging

Biome Rules:

- Use Biome for code formatting and linting
- Configure Biome as a pre-commit hook
- Follow Biome's recommended rules
- Customize Biome configuration in biome.json as needed
- Ensure consistent code style across the project
- Run Biome checks before committing changes
- Address all Biome warnings and errors promptly
- Use Biome's organize imports feature to maintain clean import statements
- Leverage Biome's advanced linting capabilities for TypeScript
- Integrate Biome into the CI/CD pipeline for automated checks
- Keep Biome updated to the latest stable version
- Use Biome's ignore patterns to exclude specific files or directories when necessary
