- Use appropriate metrics for chemistry tasks (e.g., RMSE, RÂ², ROC AUC, enrichment factor).
- Implement techniques for model interpretability (e.g., SHAP values, integrated gradients).
- Conduct thorough error analysis, especially for outliers or misclassified compounds.
- Visualize results using chemistry-specific plotting libraries (e.g., RDKit's drawing utilities).
