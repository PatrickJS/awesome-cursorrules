- Use version control (Git) for both code and datasets.
- Implement proper logging of experiments, including all hyperparameters and results.
- Use tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.
- Ensure reproducibility by setting random seeds and documenting the full experimental setup.
