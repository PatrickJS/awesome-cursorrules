Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.2. Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.3. Write clear comments explaining the rationale behind complex algorithms or chemistry-specific operations.4. Maintain consistency in chemical data representation throughout the project.Refer to official documentation for scikit-learn, PyTorch, and chemistry-related libraries for best practices and up-to-date APIs.Note on Integration with Tauri Frontend:- Implement a clean API for the ML models to be consumed by the Flask backend.- Ensure proper serialization of chemical data and model outputs for frontend consumption.- Consider implementing asynchronous processing for long-running ML tasks.
