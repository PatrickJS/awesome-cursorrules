description: Performance optimization strategies for Vue 3 Composition API applications, including bundle optimization, caching, and rendering strategies.
globs: src/**/*
---
- Use functional components for simple presentational components.
- Implement proper code splitting with dynamic imports.
- Use computed properties for expensive calculations that are used in templates.
- Implement proper bundle analysis with tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer.
- Use Vue's built-in optimization features like static hoisting.
- Implement proper pagination for large data sets.
- Use windowing/virtualization for long lists with vue-virtual-scroller.
- Optimize images with proper sizing and modern formats (WebP, AVIF).
- Implement proper lazy loading for components and images.
- Use watchEffect and watch with proper dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-execution.
- Implement proper error boundaries to prevent cascading failures.
- Use production builds for deployment with NODE_ENV=production.
- Implement proper caching strategies for API responses.
- Use service workers for caching static assets.
- Optimize CSS by removing unused styles and using efficient selectors.
- Implement proper font loading strategies.
- Use code splitting for routes with Vue Router.
- Implement proper database query optimization for backend APIs.
- Use CDN for static assets delivery.
- Monitor Core Web Vitals for performance metrics.
- Implement proper gzip/brotli compression for assets.
- Use efficient state management to minimize re-renders.
- Implement proper debounce/throttle for event handlers.
- Use CSS containment to limit browser layout calculations.
- Use Vue's reactivity system efficiently by avoiding unnecessary reactive objects.
