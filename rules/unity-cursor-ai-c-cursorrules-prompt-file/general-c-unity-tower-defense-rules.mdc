description: Applies general rules to all C# scripts within the Unity project for the tower defense game.
globs: Assets/**/*.cs

- The context for this code, in addition to the file itself and the wider project, is that I am making a tower defense style game that uses a Nintendo Ringcon as the controller.
- Players place turrets and then use exercise to charge up those turrets.
- I'm working in C# and Unity 2021.3.18f1.
- I'm refactoring the entire project, because I wrote much of it in a sprint, and I'm not sure how well it will work in the long run. I also want to be able to extend it more easily.
