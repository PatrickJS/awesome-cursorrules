- Structure notebooks with clear sections using markdown cells.
- Use meaningful cell execution order to ensure reproducibility.
- Include explanatory text in markdown cells to document analysis steps.
- Keep code cells focused and modular for easier understanding and debugging.
- Use magic commands like %matplotlib inline for inline plotting.
- Document data sources, assumptions, and methodologies clearly.
- Use version control (e.g., git) for tracking changes in notebooks and scripts.
