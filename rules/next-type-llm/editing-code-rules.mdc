description: Prioritizes the method for editing code and defines verbosity levels.
globs: *

- Editing Code (prioritized choices):
  - Return completely edited file
- Verbosity: I may use V=[0-3] to define code detail:
  - V=0 code golf
  - V=1 concise
  - V=2 simple
  - V=3 verbose, DRY with extracted functions
