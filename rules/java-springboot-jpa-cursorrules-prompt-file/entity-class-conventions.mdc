globs: **/src/main/java/com/example/entities/*.java
---
- Must annotate entity classes with @Entity.
- Must annotate entity classes with @Data (from Lombok), unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
- Must annotate entity ID with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY).
- Must use FetchType.LAZY for relationships, unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
- Annotate entity properties properly according to best practices, e.g., @Size, @NotEmpty, @Email, etc.
