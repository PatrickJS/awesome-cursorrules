- Update the Shader Code:
  - Modify the fragment shader used for rendering the simulation to incorporate region effects. This involves:
    a. Passing region data to the shader, either as a texture or uniform array.
    b. Updating the shader logic to consider region parameters when rendering cells.
    c. Implementing visual effects that reflect the influence of region parameters, such as color shifts, intensity variations, or particle effects.
    d. Optimizing the shader code to maintain performance, especially for larger simulations or complex region effects.
