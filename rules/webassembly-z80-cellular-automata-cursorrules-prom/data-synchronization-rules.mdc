- Implement Data Synchronization:
  - Create an efficient system for keeping the region grid data synchronized between the JavaScript UI and the WASM simulation. This might involve:
    a. Implementing periodic updates at set intervals.
    b. Creating an event-driven synchronization system that updates when changes occur.
    c. Optimizing large data transfers to maintain smooth performance, possibly using typed arrays or other efficient data structures.
    d. Implementing a queuing system for updates to prevent overwhelming the simulation with rapid changes.
