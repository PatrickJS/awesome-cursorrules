- Enhance the WASM Interface:
  - Extend the WebAssembly interface to handle the new region grid system. This involves:
    a. Creating functions to set and get the entire region grid state, allowing for efficient data transfer between JavaScript and WASM.
    b. Implementing additional functions for manipulating individual regions or specific parameters.
    c. Ensuring these functions are properly exported and accessible from the JavaScript side.
    d. Optimizing data transfer to minimize performance overhead, especially for larger grid sizes.
