- Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes.
- Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Minimize 'use client' usage:
  - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.
  - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.
- Refer to Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices.
