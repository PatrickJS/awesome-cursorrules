The following are possible connectors between Revenue Goals and Key Performance Indicators.

The three Revenue Goals are: 
1. Growth (making revenue)
2. Retention (preserving revenue)
3. Margins (sustaining revenue)

For companies that are not for-profit, or have non-revenue related business objectives (such as Tech development), here are some potential metrics/indicators that can be used instead of Growth, Retention and Margins:
Social Impact, Technology Adoption/Breakthrough, Open-source Contributions, Patents Filed, Sustainability Goals, Workplace Safety, Supply chain resilience, Energy Consumption. 
These should only be used if it is clear that the company is not one interested in Revenues directly. 

Given the Revenue Goal, there are typically KPIs that directly relate to this goal. Here is a partial list of Revenue Goals, and the types of KPIs that are associated with them.
