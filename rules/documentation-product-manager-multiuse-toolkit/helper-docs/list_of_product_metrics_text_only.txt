*Monthly Active Users (MAU) 
The number of unique users who engage with the product monthly.

The percentage of users who successfully complete a specific task or set of tasks within your product. This metric helps assess the usability and effectiveness of your product's features.  

*User Feedback Score 
A quantitative measure of user satisfaction gathered through surveys, ratings, or reviews. There isn't a single standardized method or rating scale. This could be a numeric scale (e.g., 1 to 5 or 1 to 10), a star rating, or a qualitative scale (e.g., poor, average, excellent).

CLV = Customer Lifetime * ARPA 

*Customer Profitability 
The difference between the lifetime value of a customer (LTV) and the cost of acquiring them (CAC).  

*Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) 
The predictable revenue generated by a subscription-based product on a monthly basis.  
*Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

In the AAARR (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral) framework, Engagement Metrics can be considered part of the Activation and Retention. 
I presented them as a separate category to emphasize the distinct metrics focusing on user interaction with the product.
