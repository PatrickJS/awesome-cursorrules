# Epic Template Instructions
Before writing the User Stories, ask a short Clarifying Question to the user about what the Time Frame is for the feature, and what the Specific Feature is (do not provide ideas).
ONLY THEN, continue with the rest of this document.
Be sure to use the @product-context.mdc data for for initial context.
When creating epics, follow this comprehensive structure, which lists the Epics first, and then provides some ideas for user stories.

## Epic Overview
You are to generate the Epics for the product to match the time frame and scope. Try and define no more than *3* epics in total.
The epics should be different from each other, and should be in a way that is easy to understand. They should also be relevant to the product and feature scope.
For each epic, you are to provide the following information:
1. Provide a clear title following the format: "Epic: [Name]" 
2. Include a brief description (1-2 sentences) explaining the purpose and scope
3. Identify any major dependencies on other epics
4. List the business unit in charge of this (eg, Design, Engineering, Marketing)

List each epic similar to the Example below for only 2 epics, and additional epics should follow this style.
### Example Epic Output:
"Epic": "User Authentication System",
"Description": "Implement secure login and registration flows for all user types. This includes password management, session handling, and integration with existing SSO providers.",
"Dependencies": [],
"Business Unit": "Engineering"

"Epic": "Product Catalog Management",
"Description": "Create a comprehensive system for managing product listings, categories, and inventory. Enable administrators to easily add, edit, and organize products.",
"Dependencies": ["Epic: User Authentication System"],
"Business Unit": "Engineering"


## User Stories
After writing the Epics, you will write some ideas for relevant User Stories for those Epics.
Stop and think about the Epics you just wrote, and then come up with *5* User Stories each for each of the Epics.
Use the following format for the User Story:
As a [type of user], I want to [perform some task] so that I can [achieve some goal].
The User Story should be written in a tone that uses an Active Voice, and the Story is achievable.
