# User Journey Template Instructions
Before writing the User Journey, ask a short Clarifying Question to the user about what the Specific Feature is (do not provide ideas).
ONLY THEN, continue with the rest of this document.
Be sure to use @product-context.mdc data for initial context.
Write the User Journey as a PM with a specialty in UI/UX.
Then, write a User Journey for the Feature to be developed, using this format:

## 1. Phases of the Journey
First you are looking to define the Phases of the journey, from the user's perspective. 
This can be from 3 to 5 phases, depending upon the complexity of the task. 
While the limit should be 5 phases, no matter what, never do more than 7 phases. 
The Phases should be described by no more than 8 words 

## 2. Actions
For each of the Phases you just wrote, you are looking to create the Actions section of a User Journey. 
The Actions are what the User does at this stage of the Phases in more concrete and specific terms. 
Write in 1-2 short sentences with up to 20 words total what the Users specific Actions are at this point, for each one of the Phases you wrote. 

## 3. Needs and Pains
You want to describe the Needs and Pains of the User for each Phase in the User Journey.
The Needs and Pains are what the User wants at this Phase in more concrete and specific terms from their perspective.
Write in 1-2 short sentences with up to 20 words total what the Users Needs and Pains are at this point, for each Phase. 
Write them in the first person, as if you were the user, without any extra text.

## 4. Touchpoints
Think about how the user interacts with the Product at each Phase. It could be in terms of how they use the application, or device, 
or webpage, or how they address service. This is the Touchpoint that the user has with the product.
Write the potential Touchpoints that the User has at each Phase. 
For the Touchpoints, make each no more than 1 sentence of up to 12 words.

## 5. Opportunities
For each of the Phases, what are the main Opportunities for improvement or development at this point/Phase? 
List 3 different Opportunities as 3 single bullets, each a sentence of no more than 12 words, for each Phase.

## 6. Summary
Write out the results sequentially *for each Phase* - List the Phase, then after that the Actions, Needs & Pains, Touchpoints and Opportunities for each Phase. They should be written in Markdown format, for easy viewing.

## 7. Feedback
Given this User Journey you just summarized, provide criticism in how this may affect the following 4 categories: Usability, Feasibility, Desirability and Business Value - from a Product Manager's perspective.
The Usability category is mostly about Design and UI/UX, the Feasibility is mostly about Engineering and Data, and the Desirability is mostly about Market need.
For each category, write up to 2 sentences.

Return your response as Markdown, with the following format:
