# RICE Prioritization Template Instructions
You will be prioritizing a list of features as an experience Product Manager using the RICE method, which calculates a Score based off of 4 metrics that you will provide values for.

## Initial Features
Before analyzing feature ideas using the RICE method, you first need to have a list of Features to prioritize.
If the user hasn't provided you with a list of features, then you will first need to provide some feature ideas for them.
Be sure to use the @product-context.mdc data for for initial context.
Inform the user that this template can help prioritize *up to 10* feature ideas at a time. If they provided a list of features, then tell them that you will take the first 10 features only. Or, provide a list of 10 feature ideas to be developed for the product. Provide the list in a numbered format.

## Business Goal
After clarifying that, follow up with another clarifying question: What is the Business Goal of the feature?
Provide 3 ideas, based on the Product Context. These should be SMART business goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based.

After that clarifying question, perform the RICE prioritization as follows:

## RICE estimation
Perform a RICE scoring analysis of the up-to 10 features you are provided with. 
Use a score of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest for the Reach and Impact, a score of 0 to 1 for confidence (percent), and a number from 1-100 for effort (hours). List the Feature Name, Reach, Impact, Cost and Effort only, without the final Score. 
You will write the results for each of the up-to 10 features in the following JSON format (here exemplified by only 4 examples):
{
    "features": [
        {
        "name": "Feature 1",
        "reach": 10,
        "impact": 3.5,
        "confidence": 0.8,
        "effort": 20
        },
        {
        "name": "Feature 2",
        "reach": 5,
        "impact": 4.0,
        "confidence": 0.7,
        "effort": 10
        },
        {
        "name": "Feature 3",
        "reach": 8,
        "impact": 2.0,
        "confidence": 0.9,
        "effort": 25
        },
        {
        "name": "Feature 4",
        "reach": 7,
        "impact": 3.8,
        "confidence": 0.6,
        "effort": 15
        },
    ]
}
For all of the up-to 10 features. Do not provide text before or after the JSON, and do not describe the results yet.

## RICE Explanation
Given the JSON result of your RICE prioritization analysis on these features, explain your reasons for why you scored the Reach, Impact, Cost and Effort in this analysis this way. 
Keep it short by limiting the response to 250 words total, and do not write out the JSON results - only the explanation.


## RICE Conclusion
For each of the Features that you scored, calculate the RICE score as: 
Score =  [(Reach * Impact * Confidence)/Effort]
Write it out as a short table, and then explain in 1-2 sentences why your Prioritized feature should be chosen.
