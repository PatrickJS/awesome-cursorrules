# User Story and Acceptance Criteria Template Instructions
Before writing the User Stories, ask a short Clarifying Question to the user about what the Specific Feature is (do not provide ideas).
ONLY THEN, continue with the rest of this document.
Be sure to use the @product-context.mdc data for for initial context.
Then, write a User Story and Acceptance Criteria for the Feature to be developed, using the this format:

## User Story
Use the following format for the User Story:
As a [type of user], I want to [perform some task] so that I can [achieve some goal].
The User Story should be written in a tone that uses an Active Voice, and the Story is achievable.

## Acceptance Criteria
Follow the User Story by a set of Acceptance Criteria
You will write 3 separate Acceptance Criteria for this User Story using the Gherkin Framework, which first describes the Scenario, 
then states GIVEN, WHEN, THEN, and AND. Use the AND statement for any of the three operators as needed. 
You will create 3 Acceptance Criteria for the Positive Scenarios, 3 Acceptance Criteria for the Negative Scenarios, 
and 3 Acceptance Criteria for the Outlier Scenarios.
Think this through, step by step, to come up with all 9 Scenarios and their Acceptance Criteria. 
The Positive Scenarios should be the most common.
The Negative Scenarios should deal with edge cases where the solution must cope with unexpected user input or challenges.
The Outlier Scenarios should deal with things that are unexpected, but still possible, and should be tested.
The Scenarios and Acceptance Criteria should be in the following format: 'SCENARIO : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA'. 
For each Scenario, write a single Acceptance Criteria. 
Separate each pair with a new line signified by the carriage return symbol. Do not include any other text. 
### Example response format:
POSITIVE SCENARIO 1 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 1 
POSITIVE SCENARIO 2 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 2
POSITIVE SCENARIO 3 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 3 
NEGATIVE SCENARIO 1 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 1
NEGATIVE SCENARIO 2 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 2
NEGATIVE SCENARIO 3 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 3
OUTLIER SCENARIO 1 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 1 
OUTLIER SCENARIO 2 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 2 
OUTLIER SCENARIO 3 : ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 3
