# KPI to Revenues Connector Instructions
Before writing the KPI-Revenue Connector, ask a short Clarifying Question to the user about what the Specific Feature is (do not provide ideas).
ONLY THEN, continue with the rest of this document. 
**Also, advise the user that it may be better to manually switch to Gemini 2.5, which has a larger context window for this**

Be sure to use @product-context.mdc data for for initial context.
Then, sequentially answer the following sections to help create Metrics for a Product Manager to help explain the "Why" for a product:

## 1. Product Goals
Based on the product information provided, generate 5 specific, measurable Product Goals that align with the product's mission and target market.
The Product Goal expresses customer pain points, needs and desires. 
The Product Goal should be something about the PRODUCT that involves a change in behavior or type of USERS using the product that will help the company achieve a Business Goal. 
Provide 5 options for potential Product Goals for the given Specific Feature being developed that would match and address the company's solution for its product, customers and mission statement. 
They can include some of the previous context provided, but provide a few more options that are not in the context.
Each Product Goal should be written as a SMART goal with a Specific objective that is also Measurable (have a specific number or percentage) and time-limited. 
They should be focused on the product and the USERS of the product, not the business.
Write the goals as a list of NUMBERED bullets.

**Ask the user a Clarifying question, which of the 5 Product Goals they would like to use. Only continue once you have a single Product Goal defined by the user!**

## 2. KPIs
Given this Product/Feature being developed and Product Goal, create 5 relevant KPIs that would be best to keep track of the feature. Each KPI should be up to 6 words. 
They can include some of the previous context provided, but provide a few more options that are not in the context.
You can use the KPIs listed here for software product: 
@list_of_product_metrics_text_only.txt
Write a list of KPIs as separate bullets.

## 3. KPI Relationships
Given the following Product Goal: [product_goal]
And the selected KPI for the Product/Feature: [kpis]
The goal now is to relate each KPI listed to a Revenue goal, while summarizing in a single line how it helps achieve that goal. 
To do so, you will need to first look at the KPI and decide what kind of Subcategory metric it relates to.
You should follow the examples below to find the relationship between KPIs and Revenue Goals:
@kpi_revenues.txt

Once you have found the relationship between the KPI and the Revenue Goal, we are looking to make a list of the following:
1. Revenue Goal name (from the list)
2. Short sentence Explanation for how the Product goal and KPI are related to the Revenue Goal

For each of the KPIs, write the 
- KPI
- Revenue Goal
- Explanation


## 4. North Star Metric
Given the [product_goal] you wrote, the selected KPIs: [selected_kpis] and the KPI Relationships to Revenue [kpi_rel_prompt_text]:

Define a single North Star Metric that best captures the core value our product delivers to customers.
This metric should:
1. Be directly tied to customer value
2. Be measurable
3. Be actionable
4. Be predictive of long-term success

In up to 60 words, briefly rephrase all of this information into the following template (you can change the words to fit the product and goals): 
For (target customer) with this (problem), we propose (solution). Our primary goal is (Product goal). We will know we're successful when (main KPI metric).

Make the style of the North Star Metric be somewhat of a marketing tone - so that it is relevant for the entire team to understand - while being concise.
Only write out the response in the specific format, without any other text before or after.

Follow this by listing the ONE Metric that best captures the core value our product delivers to customers. Write it as: 
"One Metric That Matters Most: [Metric]
