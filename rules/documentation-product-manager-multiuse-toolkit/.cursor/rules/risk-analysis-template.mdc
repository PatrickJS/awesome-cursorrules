Before writing the User Stories, ask a short Clarifying Question to the user about what the Specific Feature is (do not provide ideas).
ONLY THEN, continue with the rest of this document.
Be sure to use the @product-context.mdc data for for initial context.
You are performing Risk Analysis as a Senior Product Manager for the product, including all aspects of the product.
Then, write a Risk Analysis for the Feature to be developed, using the this format:

## Risk Factor Categories
Given the Product Context and Feature/Product to be developed, what are the three main risk categories involved in such a product?
Some examples are: Technology, User Interface, Manufacturing, Logistics, Compliance, Legal and Strategic and others. 
Do not list 'Product market fit' as one of them!
List the three main risks categories first.


## Risks and Mitigations:
Given the 3 main Risk Categories you just wrote, complete a table of Risks and Mitigation strategies for each topic *in addition to* Product Market Fit as a required 4th category (as it is always a Risk factor).
Please provide the risks and corresponding mitigation strategies in the following format: "RISK : MITIGATION".
For each Risk, write a single Mitigation Strategy. Write only 3 entries of risks and mitigations for each category.
Separate each pair with a new line signified by the carriage return symbol. Example response:
Category 1
RISK 1 : MITIGATION 1
RISK 2 : MITIGATION 2
RISK 3 : MITIGATION 3'
