# Lean Canvas Template Instructions

Be sure to use the @product-context.mdc data for initial context.
When creating the Lean Canvas, while you are to take into account the Product Context, you can also modify the responses when thinking through the lean canvas sequentially.

Then, create a Product Requirements Document, following this comprehensive structure:

## 1. Problem 
Rethink the top 3 Problems that this product will be solving, for the Lean Canvas. You can take the existing list of problems, or come up with new ones. Write the 3 top Problems in a list of short, 1-line Bullets, with no extra text.

## 2. Solution
Given the Problems and listed Solution, Rethink the top 3 aspects of our Solution for this problem, for the Lean Canvas. The Solutions should be based on what was given, but summarize them in a list of short, 1-line Bullets, with no extra text.

## 3. Unfair Advantage
What would you describe as being our Unfair Advantage, given the Solution and Differentiator in this space.
Provide a short list of 3 Unfair Advantage bullets in 1-line each, with no extra text.

## 4. Key Metrics
Give 3 bullets describing how best to measure success of the solution given for this problem using Key Metrics.
Each bullet should be only 1 line, with no extra text.

## 5. Customer Segment
Rethink the top 3 potential Target Customers for this product, for the Lean Canvas. 
The Customers should be based on what was given, but summarize them in a list of short, 1-line Bullets, with no extra text.

## 6. Channels
What would be the best way to reach customers? Provide a single line bullet, with no extra text, for each of these: 
1. Potential partners to market with (if applicable)? 2. Best marketing method? 3. direct or indirect marketing?

## 7. Unique Value Proposition
Given the previous information, create a 1-line Unique Value Proposition (UVP) for the product, with no extra text.

## 8. Revenue
Given the previous information, write the best revenue model for this business in 1 line, with no extra text.
Follow it with another 1-line with a second-best revenue model.

## 9. Costs
Given the previous information, write 4 bullets for the main costs of the product development. Each bullet should be 1 line, with no extra text.
