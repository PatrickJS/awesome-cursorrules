# PRD Template Instructions
Before writing the User Stories, ask a short Clarifying Question to the user about what the Time Frame is for the feature, and what the Specific Feature is (do not provide ideas).
ONLY THEN, continue with the rest of this document.
Be sure to use the @product-context.mdc data for initial context.
Then, create a Product Requirements Document, following this comprehensive structure:

## 1. Market Problem
Describe the Market Problem being solved, or difficulty in this market, that requires change. 
Do not mention specific solutions. Write the Market Problem as a single paragraph, of up to 160 words.
Then, describe the Market Opportunity for this problem. What is the market size for this problem and field, as found in existing market reports or similar report? 
Keep the description of the Market Opportunity as a single paragraph that is less than 160 words.

## 2. Why Solve This?
Given the Mission Statement and the Market Problem and Opportunity, and with general understanding of the Market involved,
provide 2 logical reasons why we can know that this problem is worth solving, using *only* 2 short sentences.
Make sure that the reasons match the Mission Statement and the Market Problem and Opportunity.

Then, add an additional sentence explaining why you think this will increase the Business Value of the company. 

## 3. Competition Summary
Given this information about the problem and solution, list 5 potential competitors for what we are developing. 
List them as 5 bullets, with each bullet being no more than 10 words.

## 4. Target Customers
The Customer is the person who pays for the product, but not necessarily the User, unless the User is the Customer (e.g. in a B2C or B2B2C model). 
I want you to summarize the following information, about who we are building this solution for: 
First describe the general Customers (who will pay for the product), in a single sentence. 
Next, write a list of why the Customer would want to buy a solution for this problem following these questions: 
1. Why would the customers want to buy a solution for this problem?
2. Why would the customers prefer our product over the competition?
3. What is influencing the customers buying decision (such as price, or culture, or trends, or peer, or income)?
4. What is their goal in obtaining a solution?

## 5. Success Criteria
Summarize this information, about how we know if we have solved the problem, using no more than 3 lines of text, with no more than 120 words in total. 
Only describe the Metrics themselves, not the problem, for example: 
'We will reduce costs and increase our market share by 10%. In addition, we will reduce the amount of time needed for each task'

## 6. Feature List
Given the following information about the product, solution and differentiator, list the key features and functionalities expected of the product.
List the top 5 features, and each feature should be a single sentence, no more than 15 words each.

## 7. Product Requirements
Provide a list of System Requirements and demands that are applicable for the Product and shape the solution.
First, write 'Development Requirements', followed by 3 short sentences describing the requirements that constitute the solution's development environment.
Regarding software, these are often the development tools and API sets.
Second, write 'Compatibility Requirements', followed by 3 short sentences describing conformance demands and conditions that support the solution and constitute the environment in which the solution will operate.  
Regarding software, these are elements such as: operating system platforms, GUI interfaces, or supported standards.
Third, write 'Performance Requirements', followed by 3 short sentences that list requirements that reflect the need for certain levels of speed, usability, capacity, or scalability.
These three categories should each have three requirements listed as short sentences with up to 15 words each, and the total amount of text should be up to 300 words. 
Write the response in Markdown format, and use a tone that implies what Could be done and not what Should be done.

## 8. Technological Overview

Second, write 'Solution Dependencies', here you will list in up to 4 sentences the potential dependencies for the solution, such as other products, services, or technologies that the solution will use.
Third, write 'Solution Risks', here you will list in up to 4 sentences the potential risks for the solution, such as technical risks, market risks, or other risks.
Write only these two sections, with no extra text, in Markdown format.

## 9. Milestones
Provide a list of milestones for this project, given the timeframe, features and problem-solution set. 
Consider phases like planning, design, development, testing, and launch.
List the major milestones, along with their approximate due date, from the time of the project starting, 
Try not to list more than 8 lines in total. 
Each milestone should be written as a Markdown bullet point with no more than 10 words each, followed by a short description, followed by an estimated due date, like this:

## 12. Press Release
As a Product Marketer, you are using the 'Working Backwards' method of defining a product, by first writing a Product Release statement. The press release shouldn't contain too many buzzwords, and should be in a matter-of-fact tone. 
Given a placeholder product name: <use the product name listed above> , and the customers, problem and solution listed above, you will describe the benefits to the user as a Press Release for this new goal. The format of the press release is:
TITLE:string
SUBTITLE: Subtitle summarizing the solution in a short sentence
'New York, NY - in another: XX mo/wk/yr 
What the problem is, in 3-4 sentences.\\n\\n 
What the solution our product provides, including how the new goal product/feature listed solves a real problem, written in 3-4 sentences. 
A fake quote by a leader named Joe Johnson saying why we built this new particular feature.\\n\\n
How the customer would use the solution to solve their problems, in 2-3 sentences.\\n\\n 
Another fake quote by a fake customer named Wanda Woods saying how this new feature solved her exact problem.

Write the response using Markdown format, with the \\n used above to signify new lines.

## 13. Potential Complaints

1. value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it)

3. feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have)
4. business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)
