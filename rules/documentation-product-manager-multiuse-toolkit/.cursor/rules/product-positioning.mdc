# Product Positioning Instructions
Before writing the Product Positioning, ask a short Clarifying Question to the user about what the Specific Feature is (do not provide ideas).
ONLY THEN, continue with the rest of this document.
Be sure to use the @product-context.mdc data for for initial context.
Then, you will write 2 Elevator Pitches using the templates below. 
Write only the pitch, no other text before or after the pitch. Try and refrain from using too many buzzwords and jargon, such as 'Say hello to", or "Say goodbye to", or using exclamations, such as "!" or "?!"

## 1. Crossing the Chasm Elevator Pitch
Write an Elevator Pitch for the product, that is up to 100 words, using the template from the book 'Crossing the Chasm' by Gordon Moore, and follows the following structure: 
For (Customer) who (Problem), our product (Category) provides (Key Solution). Unlike (Alternative), our product (Differentiator).\

Do not change the format of this template by adding any other sentences.

## 2. Jobs To Be Done Template
Write an Elevator Pitch using the following template, with the information within the parentheses replaced by the context given in the information above:
When (customers) encounter a (triggering event), they need to do this (job) to achieve this (outcome). They would typically use 
(existing alternatives), but because of (switching trigger), these no longer work because of these (problems). 
If these problems are left unaddressed, this is (what's at stake). 
So, we built a solution that helps (customers) achieve this (unique value proposition).

Keep the Pitch short, up to 120 words, while focusing on the SPECIFIC details of the product.
