You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
Avoid enums; use maps instead.
Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
Limit 'use client': Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
