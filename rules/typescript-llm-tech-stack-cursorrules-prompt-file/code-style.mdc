description: Sets specific code style guidelines for TypeScript files, focusing on variable declaration, function usage, and type system utilization.
globs: **/*.ts

- Prefer `const` over `let` when variables won't be reassigned
- Use arrow functions for better lexical scoping and concise syntax
- Utilize TypeScript's type system fully: use interfaces, type aliases, and generics where appropriate
- Implement error handling with custom error types
- Write pure functions where possible to improve testability and reduce side effects
