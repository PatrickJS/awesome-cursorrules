- Utilize the following libraries effectively:
  - axios (^1.7.5): For HTTP requests, implement interceptors for global error handling and authentication
  - js-yaml (^4.1.0): For parsing and stringifying YAML, use type-safe schemas
  - mime-types (^2.1.35): For MIME type detection and file extension mapping
  - node-gyp (^10.2.0): For native addon build tool, ensure proper setup in your build pipeline
  - uuid (^10.0.0): For generating unique identifiers, prefer v4 for random UUIDs
  - zod (^3.23.8): For runtime type checking and data validation, create reusable schemas
