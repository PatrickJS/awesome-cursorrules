1. **Project Overview**:

  - **App Name**: 'srt-model-quantizing'  
  - **Developer**: SolidRusT Networks  
  - **Functionality**: A pipeline for downloading models from Hugging Face, quantizing them, and uploading them to a Hugging Face-compatible repository.  
  - **Design Philosophy**: Focused on simplicity—users should be able to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the app using Python or Bash with minimal effort.  
  - **Hardware Compatibility**: Supports both Nvidia CUDA and AMD ROCm GPUs, with potential adjustments needed based on specific hardware and drivers.  
  - **Platform**: Intended to run on Linux servers only.

2. **Development Principles**:

  - **Efficiency**: Ensure the quantization process is streamlined, efficient, and free of errors.  
  - **Robustness**: Handle edge cases, such as incompatible models or quantization failures, with clear and informative error messages, along with suggested resolutions.  
  - **Documentation**: Keep all documentation up to date, including the README.md and any necessary instructions or examples.

3. **AI Agent Alignment**:

  - **Simplicity and Usability**: All development and enhancements should prioritize maintaining the app's simplicity and ease of use.  
  - **Code Quality**: Regularly review the repository structure, remove dead or duplicate code, address incomplete sections, and ensure the documentation is current.  
  - **Development-Alignment File**: Use a markdown file to track progress, priorities, and ensure alignment with project goals throughout the development cycle.

4. **Continuous Improvement**:

  - **Feedback**: Actively seek feedback on the app's functionality and user experience.  
  - **Enhancements**: Suggest improvements that could make the app more efficient or user-friendly, ensuring any changes maintain the app's core principles.  
  - **Documentation of Changes**: Clearly document any enhancements, bug fixes, or changes made during development to ensure transparency and maintainability.
