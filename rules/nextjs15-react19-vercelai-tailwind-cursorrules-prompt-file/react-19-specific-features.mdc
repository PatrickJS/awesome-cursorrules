- Use `use` hook for consuming Promises and Context directly in components.
- Leverage new `useFormStatus` hook for form state management.
- Use `useActionState` form actions and state management.
- Implement Document Metadata API for better SEO and social sharing.
- Use Actions for client-side mutations with automatic loading states.
- Leverage compiler optimizations like automatic memoization.
- Use `ref` as a prop directly without needing `forwardRef`.
- Implement proper error boundaries with new error handling patterns.
- Use `useOptimistic` hook for optimistic UI updates.
- Leverage new React Compiler for automatic memoization and performance.
- Use Document Metadata API for better SEO and social sharing.
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
- Use `startTransition` for non-urgent state updates.
- Leverage new React DevTools for better debugging.
- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring UI updates.
- Implement proper key prop usage for list rendering.
- Use `useId` for generating unique IDs in server components.
- Leverage new server component features for better performance.
- Use `useSyncExternalStore` for subscribing to external stores.
- Implement proper hydration strategies for client components.
