- Use `streamText` for streaming text responses from AI models.
- Use `streamObject` for streaming structured JSON responses.
- Implement proper error handling with `onFinish` callback.
- Use `onChunk` for real-time UI updates during streaming.
- Prefer server-side streaming for better performance and security.
- Use `smoothStream` for smoother streaming experiences.
- Implement proper loading states for AI responses.
- Use `useChat` for client-side chat interfaces when needed.
- Use `useCompletion` for client-side text completion interfaces.
- Handle rate limiting and quota management appropriately.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for AI endpoints.
- Use environment variables for API keys and sensitive configuration.
- Cache AI responses when appropriate to reduce costs.
- Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring.
