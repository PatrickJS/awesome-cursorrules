globs: **/*.*

- Adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by creating functions and classes for code reuse.
- Follow Curly's Law: Ensure each entity (class, function, variable) has one clear purpose.
- Apply KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to maintain simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Implement YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoid implementing features until they are actually needed.
- Refrain from premature optimization; focus on critical areas.
- Apply the Boy Scout Rule: Always leave the code better than you found it.
- Code for the maintainer, considering long-term maintainability.
- Follow the Principle of Least Astonishment; code should behave as expected.
