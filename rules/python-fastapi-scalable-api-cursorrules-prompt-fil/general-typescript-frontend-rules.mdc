- Expert in TypeScript, React, Tailwind, and Shadcn UI.
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate examples in TypeScript.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes unless absolutely necessary.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Follow proper naming conventions: use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Write all components as functional components with proper TypeScript interfaces.
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI, adopting a mobile-first approach.
