// EXAMPLE EPIC
Here's an example of a well-structured epic:

```
# Epic: Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication

## Strategic Context
Our enterprise customers have requested SSO capabilities to streamline user management and enhance security. By implementing SSO, we can meet the requirements of larger organizations, reduce friction in the adoption process, and strengthen our position in the enterprise market segment.

## Epic Description
This epic involves implementing industry-standard SSO authentication to allow users to access our platform using their existing organizational credentials. The implementation will support SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0 protocols, integrate with major identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace), and provide administrative controls for SSO configuration.

## Target Personas
- Enterprise Administrators: Will be able to configure SSO settings, map user attributes, and manage access policies
- End Users: Will experience simplified login through their organizational identity provider
- Security Teams: Will benefit from enhanced security and centralized user management

## Business Value
- Increase enterprise adoption rate by meeting a key enterprise requirement
- Reduce customer support tickets related to account management by 30%
- Enable expansion into regulated industries with strict authentication requirements
- Improve security posture and reduce risk of credential-based attacks

## Success Metrics
- Enterprise customer acquisition: 20% increase in Q3/Q4
- User adoption: 80% of enterprise users utilizing SSO within 60 days of availability
- Support ticket reduction: 30% decrease in password reset and account access tickets
- Implementation time for new customers: Average setup time under 1 hour

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Identity provider partnerships must be established
- Security review and penetration testing must be completed before release
- User data model changes required to support external identities
- Backward compatibility with existing authentication systems must be maintained

## Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria
1. Administrators can configure SSO through a self-service admin interface
2. Users can authenticate via SSO using SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0
3. Integration with at least 3 major identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) is supported
4. Just-in-time user provisioning works correctly when a new user authenticates
5. User attribute mapping between identity providers and our system is configurable
6. Fallback authentication mechanisms exist if SSO is unavailable
7. Comprehensive audit logging of SSO events is implemented

## Technical Considerations
- Will require changes to the authentication service and database schema
- Need to implement secure token handling and validation
- Certificate management for SAML must be addressed
- Rate limiting and security measures must be implemented to prevent abuse
- Consider multi-region deployment requirements for global customers

## Timeline & Priority
- Priority: Must-have
- Target Release: Q3 Release (v2.5)
- Estimated Epic Size: XL (8-10 sprints)

## Constituent User Stories
- [ ] As an enterprise administrator, I want to configure SSO settings through the admin interface
- [ ] As an enterprise administrator, I want to map user attributes from my identity provider
- [ ] As an enterprise administrator, I want to enable/disable SSO for specific user groups
- [ ] As an end user, I want to log in using my organizational credentials via SSO
- [ ] As an end user, I want to be automatically provisioned when I first login with SSO
- [ ] As a security admin, I want comprehensive audit logs of all SSO authentication events
- [ ] As a support engineer, I want to troubleshoot SSO configuration issues
```

// EXAMPLE USER STORY
Here's an example of a well-structured user story:

```
# User Story: Configure SSO Settings Through Admin Interface

## Story
As an enterprise administrator,
I want to configure SSO settings through the admin interface,
So that I can enable my organization's users to log in using our existing identity provider.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin can access SSO configuration section in the administration console
2. Admin can enable/disable SSO for the organization
3. Admin can select the SSO protocol (SAML 2.0 or OAuth 2.0)
4. For SAML, admin can upload IdP metadata XML or enter metadata URL
5. For SAML, admin can download SP metadata for configuration in their IdP
6. For OAuth, admin can configure authorization and token endpoints
7. Admin can map identity provider attributes to user profile attributes
8. Admin can test the SSO configuration before enabling it organization-wide
9. Admin can set a fallback authentication method if SSO fails
10. Changes are saved and applied correctly

## Technical Considerations
- Must handle certificate validation for SAML metadata
- Need secure storage for IdP credentials and certificates
- Consider implementing configuration versioning for rollback capability
- UI should adapt based on selected protocol (SAML vs OAuth)

## Definition of Done
- Feature passes all acceptance criteria
- End-to-end testing completed with at least 3 major IdPs
- Documentation updated with configuration instructions
- Error handling and validation in place
- Security review completed
- Performance tested with load testing

## Dependencies
- User data model updates for external identity linking
- Admin interface framework support
- Authentication service API extensions

## Effort Estimate
13 story points (2-3 week implementation)
```

// BEST PRACTICES FOR EPICS AND USER STORIES
Follow these best practices:

1. Keep user stories independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable (INVEST)
2. Ensure epics have clear business value and strategic alignment
3. Write user stories from the user's perspective, not the system's perspective
4. Include detailed acceptance criteria that can serve as test cases
5. Consider edge cases and error scenarios in acceptance criteria
6. Make success metrics specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)
7. Break down epics into user stories that can be completed within a single sprint
8. Include technical considerations without prescribing specific implementations
9. Define clear dependencies both within and outside the epic
10. Prioritize user stories within epics to enable incremental delivery

// TEMPLATE ADAPTATION
Adapt the epic and user story templates based on:

- Your specific agile methodology (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Project management tools being used (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- Team conventions and terminology
- Organization-specific requirements and processes

When creating epics and user stories, focus on communicating clear value to both
business stakeholders and technical implementers. Balance detail with clarity
and ensure all acceptance criteria are testable.
