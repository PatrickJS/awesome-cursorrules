# Script Best Practices Checklist
- [ ] nango.paginate is used to paginate over responses in a sync
- [ ] if it is possible that an action could have a paginated response then the action should return back a `cursor` so the user can paginate over the action response
- [ ] ensure when running a sync you run it with the `--validation` flag to to make sure the schema is correct against the actual data
