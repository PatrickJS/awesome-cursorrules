description: General rules for Svelte 5 projects, including using runes for reactivity and simplifying event handlers.
globs: **/*.svelte

- Always use Svelte 5 instead of Svelte 4.
- Use runes for controlling reactivity; runes replace certain non-runes features and provide more explicit control over state and effects.
- Treat event handlers as properties for simpler use and integration.
