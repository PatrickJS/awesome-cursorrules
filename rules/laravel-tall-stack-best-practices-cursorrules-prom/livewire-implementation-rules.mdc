- Create modular, reusable Livewire components.
- Use Livewire's lifecycle hooks effectively (e.g., mount, updated, etc.).
- Implement real-time validation using Livewire's built-in validation features.
- Optimize Livewire components for performance, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- Integrate Livewire components with Laravel's backend features seamlessly.
- Implement lazy loading for Livewire components when appropriate.
