- Use Alpine.js directives (x-data, x-bind, x-on, etc.) for declarative JavaScript functionality.
- Implement small, focused Alpine.js components for specific UI interactions.
- Combine Alpine.js with Livewire for enhanced interactivity when necessary.
- Keep Alpine.js logic close to the HTML it manipulates, preferably inline.
