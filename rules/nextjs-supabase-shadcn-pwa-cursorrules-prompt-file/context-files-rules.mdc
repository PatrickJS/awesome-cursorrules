globs: **/ProjectDocs/contexts/**/*

- **Master Project Context (`projectContext.md`):**
   - Located in `/ProjectDocs/contexts/`.
   - Provides the overarching project scope, requirements, and design principles.
   - Only update this file if there are major changes to the projectâ€™s fundamental direction or scope.
- **Additional Context Files:**
   - Supplementary files (e.g., `uiContext.md`, `featureAContext.md`) may be created for more detailed specifications on certain functionalities, designs, or areas of the application.
   - Keep these files stable. Update them only when new, approved changes need to be documented.
   - Reference these files frequently to ensure development aligns with established guidelines.
- **Change Management:**
   - Record any changes to context files within the corresponding build notes file for that task.
   - Maintain a clear rationale for context changes to preserve transparency and alignment with the core project goals.
