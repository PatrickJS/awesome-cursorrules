- Target **Next.js 15+** and leverage the App Router, React Server Components (RSC), and SSR capabilities.
- Use Zustand for state management in client components when necessary.
- Maintain proper Shadcn UI management using `npx shadcn@latest add` for new components.
- Follow a mobile-first approach and responsive design patterns.
- Emphasize server-side logic, minimizing the usage of `use client` and other client-only APIs.
- Structure project as Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities, app-like experience, and installability across devices.
