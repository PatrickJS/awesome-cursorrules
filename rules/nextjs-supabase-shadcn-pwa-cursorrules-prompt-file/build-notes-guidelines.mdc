- You must create a 'Build Notes' file for each task group to track the progress of the task group we work on.
- **Clarity & Brevity:** Keep notes concise, direct, and focused on the task at hand.
- **Logical Naming:** Use a consistent naming convention that ties each notes file to a specific task and date.
- **Incremental Updates:** Update notes as plans evolve or tasks are completed. Append rather than overwrite.
- **Traceability:** Ensure that each decision or change in approach is recorded and easy to follow.
