description: Outlines the monorepo structure and tooling conventions, emphasizing the use of Taskfile.yml, and proper handling of environment variables.
globs: **/packages/**/*, **/app/**/*

- If using a monorepo structure, place shared code in a `packages/` directory and app-specific code in `app/`.
- Use `Taskfile.yml` commands for development, testing, and deployment tasks.
- Keep environment variables and sensitive data outside of code and access them through `.env` files or similar configuration.
