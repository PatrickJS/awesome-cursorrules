- You must review the `projectContext.md` as we need to ensure that the project context is up to date and accurate.
- **Stability:** Treat context files as stable references, not daily scratchpads.
- **Selective Updates:** Update context files only when there are significant, approved changes to requirements or project scope.
- **Accessibility:** Make context files easily understandable and organized so future developers can quickly grasp the projectâ€™s core guidance.
