Here's an example of a well-structured engineering ticket using the list format:

```
# Engineering Ticket: Implement Password Reset Functionality

## Description
Implement a secure password reset feature that allows users to reset their passwords via email verification. This feature should include a "Forgot Password" option on the login screen, email delivery of a secure token, and a password reset form.

## Technical Context
The authentication system currently uses JWT tokens for session management and bcrypt for password hashing. User email addresses are already verified during registration, so we can rely on them for secure communication.

## Implementation Details
1. Create a new RESTful API endpoint for initiating password reset
2. Implement a token generation service with appropriate expiration (24 hours)
3. Integrate with the existing email service to send reset instructions
4. Create a password reset form component with validation
5. Update the authentication service to handle token verification and password updates
6. Add proper error handling and security measures to prevent abuse

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can request a password reset from the login screen by providing their email address
2. System validates that the email exists in the database before sending reset instructions
3. A secure, time-limited token is generated and included in the reset link
4. Reset instructions are sent to the user's registered email address
5. Clicking the reset link opens a form allowing users to enter a new password
6. Password reset form validates password strength requirements
7. After successful reset, user receives confirmation and can log in with new credentials
8. Reset tokens become invalid after use or after 24 hours
9. System logs all password reset attempts (successful and failed)

## Testing Considerations
- Test with valid and invalid email addresses
- Verify token expiration functions correctly
- Test password validation rules
- Verify email delivery and formatting
- Test with various browsers and devices
- Security testing for token tampering attempts

## Dependencies
- Email service API integration
- User authentication service updates
- Frontend login component modifications

// EXAMPLE TICKET (GIVEN-WHEN-THEN FORMAT)
Here's an example of a well-structured engineering ticket using the BDD format:

```
# Engineering Ticket: Implement User Profile Image Upload Feature

## Description
Implement functionality allowing users to upload and update their profile images. The system should support common image formats, perform appropriate validation and optimization, and update the user's profile across the platform.

## Technical Context
The current user profile system stores user information in a PostgreSQL database with static assets stored in S3. The frontend uses React with a custom form component library. We need to extend the existing user profile API to support image uploads.

## Implementation Details
1. Extend the user profile API to accept multipart form data
2. Implement server-side image validation, resizing, and optimization
3. Configure S3 storage for profile images with appropriate permissions
4. Create a drag-and-drop image upload component for the frontend
5. Implement image cropping/preview functionality before upload
6. Update the user profile UI to display the new profile image

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: User uploads a valid profile image
Given the user is logged in and viewing their profile settings
When they click on the "Change Profile Picture" option
And they select or drag-drop a valid image file (JPG, PNG, WebP under 5MB)
And they save the changes
Then the system should upload, process, and store the image
And display the new profile image in the user's profile
And confirm the successful update with a notification

### Scenario 2: User attempts to upload an invalid file
Given the user is logged in and viewing their profile settings
When they attempt to upload an invalid file (wrong format or over 5MB)
Then the system should reject the upload
And display an appropriate error message
And maintain the current profile image

### Scenario 3: User cancels the image upload
Given the user has selected a new profile image
When they click the "Cancel" button before saving
Then the system should discard the selected image
And maintain the current profile image

## Testing Considerations
- Test with various image formats and sizes
- Verify image optimization is working correctly
- Test frontend UI for responsiveness
- Verify proper error handling
- Test accessibility of the upload component
- Verify image loading performance

## Dependencies
- S3 bucket configuration updates
- Image processing library integration
- Frontend component updates

// BEST PRACTICES FOR ENGINEERING TICKETS
Follow these best practices:

1. Use clear, descriptive titles that summarize the work to be done
2. Provide detailed context to help engineers understand why the work is necessary
3. Be specific about technical requirements and constraints
4. Define explicit, testable acceptance criteria
5. Suggest an implementation approach without being overly prescriptive
6. Include links to relevant documentation, designs, and related tickets
7. Identify dependencies and potential blockers
8. Add appropriate tags and labels for categorization
9. Estimate complexity/effort to aid sprint planning
10. Include information about priority and timing expectations

// TEMPLATE ADAPTATION
Adapt the engineering ticket templates based on:

- Your team's development methodology (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Project management tools being used (Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub, etc.)
- Team preferences for ticket format and level of detail
- Project-specific requirements and processes
- Technical complexity of the work being described

When creating engineering tickets, focus on providing the right level of detail
to enable engineers to implement the feature correctly while allowing for
technical creativity and problem-solving. Balance specificity with flexibility.
