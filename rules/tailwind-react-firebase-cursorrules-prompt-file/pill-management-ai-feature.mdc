- Design a feature for a pill management app that tracks user interactions with medications (Take/Skip) and generates monthly adherence reports.
- The app should:
  - Display pills for "Morning," "Afternoon," and "Night" with buttons for "Take" and "Skip."
  - Show a confirmation modal for user actions.
- Log user interactions (pill ID, action, timestamp, notes) in a database.
- Aggregate data to calculate total pills scheduled vs. taken, adherence percentage, and trends (e.g., frequently skipped pills).
- Use basic statistical analysis to generate personalized suggestions based on user feedback (e.g., side effects, missed doses).
- Create a section for users to view their monthly reports, including adherence percentage, trends, and AI-generated suggestions.
