description: Specific guidelines for Django views, focusing on class-based vs. function-based views, error handling, and request handling.
globs: **/views.py

- Use Djangoâ€™s class-based views (CBVs) for more complex views; prefer function-based views (FBVs) for simpler logic.
- Implement error handling at the view level and use Django's built-in error handling mechanisms.
- Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling.
