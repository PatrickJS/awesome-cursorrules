- Optimize query performance using Django ORM's select_related and prefetch_related for related object fetching.
- Use Django’s cache framework with backend support (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load.
- Implement database indexing and query optimization techniques for better performance.
- Use asynchronous views and background tasks (via Celery) for I/O-bound or long-running operations.
- Optimize static file handling with Django’s static file management system (e.g., WhiteNoise or CDN integration).
- Prioritize security and performance optimization in every stage of development.
