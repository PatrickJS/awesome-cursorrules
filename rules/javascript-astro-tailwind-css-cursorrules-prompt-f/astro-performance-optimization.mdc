Performance Optimization

- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation.
- Use the client:* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
  - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
  - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
  - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.
