- Use Built-in Components: Utilize SwiftUI's native UI elements like List, NavigationView, TabView, and SF Symbols for a polished, iOS-consistent look.
- Master Layout Tools: Employ VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, and Padding for responsive designs; use LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid for grids; GeometryReader for dynamic layouts.
- Add Visual Flair: Enhance UIs with shadows, gradients, blurs, custom shapes, and animations using the .animation() modifier for smooth transitions.
- Design for Interaction: Incorporate gestures (swipes, long presses), haptic feedback, clear navigation, and responsive elements to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
