# Xian Smart Contracts

## Introduction
Xian is a modern blockchain platform that enables developers to write smart contracts in native Python. Unlike other blockchain platforms that require specialized languages or transpilation, Xian supports direct Python coding, making it accessible to the millions of Python developers worldwide.

## What Xian Can Be Used For

- **DeFi Applications**: Create decentralized finance applications including token exchanges, lending protocols, and yield farming platforms
- **NFTs and Digital Collectibles**: Develop NFT marketplaces and digital collectible platforms with ease
- **DAOs**: Build decentralized autonomous organizations with voting mechanisms and treasury management
- **Supply Chain Solutions**: Create transparent supply chain tracking systems
- **Identity Management**: Develop self-sovereign identity solutions
- **Gaming**: Build blockchain-based games with in-game economies

## Key Features

- **Native Python Smart Contracts**: Write contracts in pure Python without transpilation
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events to track state changes and trigger actions
- **Rich Standard Library**: Access cryptographic functions, hashing utilities, and more
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Test contracts using familiar Python unittest patterns
- **State Management**: Simple yet powerful state management with Variables and Hashes
